**Part 3: Test Automation** 
Framework Selected Framework: Selenium WebDriver with TestNG

Reason:

Selenium is widely used for web application testing.
TestNG provides robust test configuration and parallel test execution.
Overview: [Provide a brief overview of the framework's architecture]

Automated Test Scripts
Implement automated scripts for:

User Registration
Product Search
Checkout Process
Test Data Management:

Utilize external data files for test data.
Use configuration files to manage test environment settings.
**Submission Requirements:**

- Your submission should be well-documented and organized.
- Provide clear instructions for setting up the test environment and running the automated tests.
- Include any necessary configuration files or dependencies.
- Submit your solution in a version-controlled repository (e.g., GitHub) and provide a link for review.
- Include a README with instructions for running the tests and any additional comments you think are relevant.

**Evaluation Criteria:**
Your assignment will be evaluated based on the clarity and completeness of your test planning, the effectiveness of your test cases, and the quality of your automated test scripts.

P.S. Any assumptions taken while design / implementation should be documented in README file
